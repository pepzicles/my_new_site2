                            On December 17, 2010 26-year-old street vendor 
                            Mohamed Bouazizi self-immolated in Sidi Bouzid,
                            Tunisia. His dramatic action is considered the 
                            start of the Arab Spring, a period of pro-democracy 
                            uprisings that reverberated through North Africa 
                            and the Middle East.

                                        Mohamed Bouazizi lived in the impoverished city of Sidi Bouzid, 
                                        about 100 miles south of the capital Tunis. As the prices of 
                                        commodities spiked across the world, Bouazizi found that rising 
                                        prices made it difficult for him to afford food for his family 
                                        with the money he earned selling produce in the center of town.

                                        On the morning of December 17, Bouazizi was selling fruit without 
                                        a government permit. A municipal inspector, confiscated Bouazizi's 
                                        merchandise and, according to some residents, slapped the fruit 
                                        seller. Bouazizi went to the police station to retrieve his

                        Outraged by the events that led to Bouazizi's self-immolation, 
                        protests began in Sidi Bouzid within hours, building for more 
                        than two weeks, with attempts by police to quiet the unrest 
                        serving only to fuel what was quickly becoming a violent and 
                        deadly movement. Bouazizi's actions also triggered a number of 
                        self-immolations, in protests emulating his own.

                        The protests, which became known as the Jasmine Revolution, 
                        lasted a month and inspired similar revolutions in <strong> Egypt, 
                        Bahrain, Yemen, Libya and Syria, </strong> where citizens railed against 
                        high unemployment, high food prices, corruption and political 
                        repression. Tunisians had grown resentful of their 
                        authoritarian government, creating a powder keg awaiting the 
                        spark of Bouazizi's public death. Unrest persisted as a new 
                        regime took over, leaving many citizens of Tunisia feeling as 
                        though their needs were still being ignored.

                        The anger and violence became so intense that President Ben Ali
