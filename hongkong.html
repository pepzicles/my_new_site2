                        Fishballs are a street-food staple in Hong Kong. For Hong Kong-born restaurateur Alan Yau, founder of Hakkasan and the Wagamama chain, the fishball has two meanings:

                    Bloodied protesters, an injured policeman on the ground being attacked, warning shots fired in the air, 50 people arrested, almost 100 injured.
